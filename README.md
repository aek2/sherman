# sherman

All software related to the Sherman robot for the MRDC competition for Chicago EDT.

This node requires the sound_play ros libraries. This is used to give audio cues to the driver of the robot.

To hear the audio cues, you must run the sound_play node by running "rosrun sound_play soundplay_node.py"

This node uses a Sick Tim 551 for laser detection.
